<h2>Jump</h2>
<p>Jump has a very similar goal to Doodle Jump. The player hops onto moving platforms, and it gets more difficult as the score increases.</p>
  
<h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Jump is a game that I programmed with a peer in my Into To CS class sophomore year of high school. It is written in pure Java. Since this was my first big cs project, it's a little laggy and the graphics aren't A1, not to mention you have to physically restart the window in order to play again. I still think it's worth uploading though. :)</p>
  
<h2>Built With</h2>
  <p>Netbeans</p>
